# AI Engineer Assignment - Customer Support Chat System


# **Time to Complete**: 2 days


**What you'll build**: A smart chat system that helps customers who want to cancel their phone plans


---


## What You're Building


Create a chat system for **TechFlow Electronics** (a phone company) that:


- Talks to customers who want to cancel their phone insurance
- Tries to help solve their problems instead of losing them as customers
- Knows when someone just needs technical help (not trying to cancel)


Think of it like training 3 different customer service agents who each have different jobs.

## Technical Requirements (MUST FOLLOW)


### **Multi-Agent Framework**


- **MUST use LangChain/LangGraph** for agent orchestration
- Demonstrate proper agent-to-agent communication
- Show state management between agents
- Clear workflow definition for agent handoffs


### **Tool Integration (Required)**


Your agents must use these 3 tools to process real data:


python


```jsx
@tool
def get_customer_data(email: str) -> dict:
    """Load customer profile from customers.csv"""


@tool  
def calculate_retention_offer(customer_tier: str, reason: str) -> dict:
    """Generate offers using retention_rules.json"""


@tool
def update_customer_status(customer_id: str, action: str) -> dict:
    """Process cancellations/changes (log to file)"""
```


### **RAG Implementation (Required)**


- Use provided policy documents for context retrieval
- Implement vector search (FAISS, Qdrant, Pinecone, or similar)
- Agents must query documents during conversations
- Show relevant information retrieval in action


### **LLM Options (Free Preferred)**


- **Recommended**: Google Gemini (free tier)
- **Alternatives**: DeepSeek, Groq, Ollama (local)
- Must demonstrate function calling or structured output
- Show proper prompt engineering


### **System Architecture Must Include**


- LangChain/LangGraph workflow orchestration
- Tool calling with real data processing
- RAG system with document retrieval
- Multi-agent state management
- Error handling and fallbacks


## The 3 Chat Agents You Need


### **Agent 1: The Greeter & Orchestrator**


- Figures out who the customer is
- Decides what kind of help they need
- Sends them to the right specialist


### **Agent 2: The Problem Solver and Communicator**


- Tries to keep customers happy when they want to cancel
- Offers solutions like discounts or pauses
- Only gives up if the customer really wants to leave


### **Agent 3: The Processor**


- Actually cancels services when needed
- Updates customer accounts
- Handles the paperwork

## What We Give You


### Customer Information


- A file with 10 fake customers and their details
- Names, emails, what they pay, how long they've been customers
- [**Download: customers.csv**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1voDrL0XvMXs9ZVM0CfcFt64THtsRcFEV/view?usp=sharing)


### **Business Rules**


- A guide for what discounts you can offer different customers
- When to offer payment breaks vs. discounts
- [**Download: retention_rules.json**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ISZNUxm-J_E0QZMzKZd4IzzrjH02FVdq/view?usp=sharing)


### **Company Policies**


Your agents will need to reference these documents to provide accurate information:


- **Return Policy**: Customer tiers, refund procedures, processing times
- **Care+ Benefits**: Complete insurance coverage details and value explanations
- **Tech Support Guide**: When to escalate technical issues vs handle in chat
- [**Download: Policy Documents Bundle**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10tYc5SaQEYw_DrJSretng9bNldACz-RQ?usp=sharing)


### **Conversation Templates**


- Structured scripts for handling different cancellation scenarios
- Empathy phrases and discovery questions
- **Note**: Convert these into your agent system prompts
- [**Download: retention_playbook.md**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OLTziMTWqoEEk-ykV_zuh4u3kL9n__rw/view?usp=sharing)

## Test Your System With These 5 Conversations


### **Test 1: Money Problems**


Customer says: *"hey can't afford the $13/month care+ anymore, need to cancel"*


**Expected**: Try to help with payment pause or discount before canceling


*Agent should use: Business rules + Customer data to calculate personalized offers*


### **Test 2: Phone Problems**


Customer says: *"this phone keeps overheating, want to return it and cancel everything"*


**Expected**: Offer phone replacement or upgrade before canceling


*Agent should use: Return policy + Tech guide to offer solutions*


### **Test 3: Questioning Value**


Customer says: *"paying for care+ but never used it, maybe just get rid of it?"*


**Expected**: Explain what they get for their money, offer cheaper options


*Agent should use: Care+ benefits document to explain value*


### **Test 4: Technical Help Needed**


Customer says: *"my phone won't charge anymore, tried different cables"*


**Expected**: Send directly to tech support (don't try to sell anything)


*Agent should use: Tech support guide to recognize non-cancellation intent*


### **Test 5: Billing Question**


Customer says: *"got charged $15.99 but thought care+ was $12.99, what's the extra?"*


**Expected**: Send directly to billing department (don't try to sell anything)


*Agent should recognize this as billing inquiry, not cancellation*
